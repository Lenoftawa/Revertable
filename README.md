# Revertable
There has always been contention over whether blockchains should allow reversion when loss has occurred accidentally or by malicious intent.  This can be handeld at the blochchain level where the blochcains such as Bitcoin and Bitcoin forks, which suppoert a single contract.
In Ethereum, the blockchain does not represent a single contract but a collection of contracts created by 3rd parties.  The Dao hack and now the Parity Froze Ether have resulted in heated discussion on wheather and how to recover lost funds.  This is somewhat fraught as the only option is a fork of and there is a very valid argument that blockchains need to be immutable to be trusted.  On the other hand, the Bitcoin position that the contract must hold is not completely applicable since contracts built on Ethereum are really data.  
This project contends that blockchains should not be responsible for the govenance of the contracts. The blockchain should not need to fork because of 'bad data'.  In essence, each contract represents a chain within a chain, that should be responsible for it's own govenance model.  Building this into the contract itself allows flexibility in governance models depending on the application and user community, thus relieving the Blockchain of this responsibility. 
A Revertable contract supports interface discovery and the ability to request reversion by any party by defering to a nominated external arbitration contract.  The arbitration contract can use any means to propose or select the reversion process and obtain consesus on whether to execute it.
An arbitration contract represent a trusted human entity (individual, organisation or court), an automous smart contract (eg a DAO), or an oracle.
The arbitration process will result in no action, the execution of code, the replacement of data and/or replacement of the code.
Arbitration has a cost and may require the requester to pay additional fees before reversion proceeds.  The fee schedule will of course be pre-defined as part of the governance model.
